About to go to bed after a whirl wind day. Just wanted to say best wishes and God’s graces to everyone this new year. Times have been tough for everyone, but through it all we’ve pulled through.

On a side note, as I’ve been feeling the crunch of 6 months left, I bit the bullet and looked at dresses on NYE. After 8 dresses, I “said yes to the dress”. That’s one more thing down and several more to go. Hopefully my friends &amp; family can pull through in the end. As much as I hate asking for help &amp; relying on others, a wedding just isn’t right without your friends &amp; family having your back.

Now time to sleep! Good night!
