Churro style = cheap

Given the fact that weddings cost so much money, I thought I’d try to make my own photobooth. Not only is it cheaper to make my own but I actually have most of the parts, and not only that… the parts are all from stuff I never really used. Now if I end up using these parts, they will finally get some good usage

Ingredients:

computer – mini ITX board (Given to me by Robert). Also some DDR2 sticks I bought that I never installed on my mom’s computer

camera – canon a85 which I bought back in 2004 for a black friday sale. I’ll buy anything during black friday, especially if I don’t need it. I’ve used this camera 1 or 2 times in my life. The exciting part is that this camera is on the list of camera’s that might work with sparkbooth: <http://sparkbooth.com/2011/04/use-a-canon-digital-camera-with-sparkbooth/>

printer – compact photo printer (hp q7117a). I bought this for my dad, and I think he used up the sample photo papers that came with it and never used it again.

usb touchscreen – This I’m going to have to buy – but I saw one for under 100 bucks on ebay. I could replace this and the computer with a netbook which is rarely used, but I don’t think having people use a keyboard is classy.

software – looking at sparkbooth for the software – I would also like to look at a linux distro if possible since this is going to be a dedicated function. Also it would be free!

The Costs – if I use linux and a netbook, I would just have to buy a dc adapter for my camera – $10. If I use windows, sparkbooth, and usb touchscreen, it should cost less than $150. Also if I want to make a box to house everything in. I might have to add on another 50 bucks… and consumables… which I won’t factor in.

update: Decided Robert was the best man for this job… He’s helping make everything for us.
