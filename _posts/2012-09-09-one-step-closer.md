So it’s official! After weeks of emails, phone calls, rants, and mishaps, we finally have our date set! July 6, 2013! The ceremony will be at 12:00pm. Now I can finally send in my application for the reception venue. So stressful doing this all long distance without Arturo here! Oh well no worries. After that I guess we need to get our engagement photos done, addresses to collect and save the date thingys to send out…blah.
