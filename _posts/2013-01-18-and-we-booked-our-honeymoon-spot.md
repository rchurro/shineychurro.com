Today we finally put a deposit for our trip to our honeymoon! We only live once and we rarely splurge on ourselves, but this time we decided to take the plunge and get it out of our system. Weâ€™re going to Europe! More specifically UK, France then Italy ðŸ™‚ Iâ€™m so excited! Iâ€™ve never been to Europe and Arturo has never been to Paris or Italy, so it will be wonderful experience for both of us. Now time to figure out how to pack super light, not get mugged, and not get lost. One thingâ€™s for sure, after looking at packages and flights on our own, ultimately you do get more security and better upgrades when you talk to your travel agent over doing everything on your own. I still canâ€™t believe it! ðŸ˜€
