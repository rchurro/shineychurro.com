Hello all! We just got back from our honeymoon yesterday! It was truly a wonderful experience. We canâ€™t wait to do it again. Weâ€™re also super tired, so weâ€™re trying to sleep off the jet lag.

Thank you all for coming to see us on our wedding day! We felt so blessed and loved with all the family and friends who came and those who were there in spirit. We couldnâ€™t have asked for anything better. We feel so fortunate and we are eternally grateful for everyone who contributed to help make such a special day happen particularly our families, parents, brother, sisters, God Parents, cousins, and great friends.

Unfortunately, I do not currently have pictures from our photographer, but Iâ€™ve seen a few pictures from our family on facebook, so feel free to check there and friend me if you havenâ€™t already. Iâ€™ll be posting a few pictures from our honeymoon as soon as I get them sorted out. It was a little hard to get internet access while in Europe and we barely had time to backup our files let alone post them :\\ so Iâ€™ll do my best to have a few of them on here ðŸ™‚ Hereâ€™s one of our pictures from our gondola ride in Venice, Italy!![](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7410/9351819516_d54b1a13d2_c.jpg)

Love,

Shine &amp; Arturo
