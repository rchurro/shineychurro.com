After much anxiety, I was able to set up a date to do some tasting with our caterer. Thankfully we were automatically booked with them once we booked our venue. That has been plaguing my mind since I’ve been having difficult scheduling a time to go and see them to do the tasting, the ultimately finalize our menus and the specifics of the event. Anyway, that’s coming up in a few weeks and now I just need to get the frills taken care of (video, photo, DJ, decor/flowers, etc.). Nightmares have subsided!
