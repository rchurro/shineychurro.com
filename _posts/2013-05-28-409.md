Weâ€™re on the last few days left until the wedding and we got a few more things checked off our list ðŸ™‚ Marriage contract and final meeting with the church is complete! Bridesmaids dresses are done. We picked out our wedding cake bakerâ€“Ali from The Sugar Lab in Ventura! Thank goodness! Our consultation went so well we signed the contract on the spot.

Things left to do include getting the final schedule/ideas sent to our video/photog people and DJ, finding a makeup and hair person, and what to do with the bouquets? Iâ€™m tempted to make them myself, but Iâ€™ve been advised against it. Weâ€™ll see how that goes. So far Arturo and I have mastered the art of DIYing. Letâ€™s see how much we can do!
