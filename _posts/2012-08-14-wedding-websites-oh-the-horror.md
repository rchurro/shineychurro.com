So Arturo and I have been playing around with trying to find a decent free hosting site for our website. I though I finally found one with a decent layout and service, only it does not allow domain masking. Why is that an issue? Well we have our shineychurro.com domain and it redirects to the host rather than masking it and I find that really annoying and so does Arturo. I don’t think that’s very fair that they can plaster their name on the bottom of your page and yet not allow their user to use their personalized domain name. So while we have our website currently hosted on weddingwire, I’m open for options. I’d rather not build a website from the ground up if there’s something out there that can suit our needs.
