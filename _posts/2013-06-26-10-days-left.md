I canâ€™t believe time has gone by this quickly and in a little over a week we will be married! So far weâ€™ve had two awesome showers by both families. Thank you all so very much! We felt the love and are eager to see all of you at the wedding ðŸ™‚

Thereâ€™s a few loose ends here and there and a vendor or two to finish paying, but so far so good. I will have to say that planning this wedding on our own has made me feel like an expert planner already hah! Anyway, we hope to see all of youâ€“family and friends. Weâ€™ll be sure to post pictures of the day, and if possible when we go to our honeymoon to Europe right after. So exciting!
