[![Camarilllo Premium Outlets](https://wordpress.shineychurro.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/camarilllo-premium-outlets.jpg?w=300)](https://wordpress.shineychurro.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/camarilllo-premium-outlets.jpg)

If you are fashion/brand clothing junkie, this place is for you. Two large premium outlet malls with almost every famous brand out there Armani to Hurley. I try to avoid this place when I can cause there’s just so many tourists. Right in the middle is the movie theater Edward’s Cinema and down the street is an In-n-out, so you don’t have to have Wetzel’s Pretzels, Panera, or food court food if you get hungry.

One of my most favorite places to go every time I visited Oxnard/Ventura. It hasn’t changed much since I remember going here when I was 7 and definitely has the nostalgia kick in every time I play. If you love miniature golf as much as you love freedom, head out to this place. They have pizza, old arcade games, tokens, Go Carts, bumper cars, speed cars, bumper boats and LASER tag.
