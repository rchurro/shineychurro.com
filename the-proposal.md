<span style="font-family:lucida sans unicode, lucida grande, sans-serif;">On February 12, 2012 Arturo, Sherymer and their friends Suzy and Carlos took a hike at Joshua Tree National Forest after seeing some of the sights and relaxing in near by Palm Springs. </span>

<span style="font-family:lucida sans unicode, lucida grande, sans-serif;">What appeared to be a typical hike turned out to be a moment they could never forget. The sun was nice and bright and for the dessert, there was a nice cool breeze in the air. After hiking and checking out a few spots, the sun was starting to run low and it was almost time to go home. Not wanting to end the day before poping the question, Arturo quickly found a mini mountain of large rocks and boulders and found his spot. Asking Suzy to take their picture at the top, Sherymer reluctantly agreed to try and climb the fairly high mini mountain. After what appeared like a near death experience, Arturo helped Sherymer up to a beautiful view and started declaring his love. Touched, but also concerned theyâ€™d miss their photo opportunity, Sherymer quickly reminded Arturo that Suzy was waiting to take their picture.</span>

<span style="font-family:lucida sans unicode, lucida grande, sans-serif;">Sherymer quickly posed again, but Arturo remained facing Sherymer and began fiddling with his cargo short pocket and pulled out a black velvet box with a beautiful ring. Shocked and overwhelmed, Sherymer was speechless (which apparently is a rarity according to Arturo) and her life flashed before her eyes. She could not beleive this was happening at that moment. By the time Arturo popped the question, all she could manage was a head nodd, but that was enough for him. Suzy eventually got a chance to take the picture of them at the top, but this time Sherymer was the one who wasnâ€™t ready ðŸ˜‰</span> ![](https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/412443_10150588850687514_1095139658_o.jpg)
